# Vision:

We wanted to make a tower defense game that we have never seen before. We took inspiration from games we loved like Pokemon, to add a new flavor to the tower defense genre. Utilizing the Unity game engine we combined what we loved from both genres to create a unique take on tower defense games.

# What I Learned:

I can really only speak for what I learned from the project. However, I felt this project really furthered my understanding of game systems and even other computer science concepts. This was my first time actually working with complex programmer defined data types, it greatly increased my understanding how objects/classes work and I have carried that knowledge throughout my education. I also dove into the pathfinding algorithms which came in handy useful later in my educational career. -Aidan
